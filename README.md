# e-journal

This app is an electronic diary called Confidant. Its purpose is for users to create entries, and view all entries in a calendar or list view. 
The calendar view shows the titles of each entry on their respective date of occurence. Users will be able to see what they wrote about in the past,
and can check what they were thinking about a year ago.

Features to be worked on:
- All entries sorted by date (most recent at top)
- Make a button on the calendar that moves through years, not just months
- User ability to upload images
- Indentation/paragraph breaks in the submitted entry should be seen in the rendered entry
- Searchbar in all entries
- Have a pop up of "a year ago today..."
